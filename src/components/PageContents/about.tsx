          Hallo There! my name is <b>Farel</b>. and I’m from Indonesia. I have a
          deep passion for exploring the IT world because I easily get bored
          doing just one thing. Fortunately, the technology field always has
          something new to learn, so I can challenge myself with different
          aspects of it.

          Right now, I’m diving into cybersecurity, but man... it’s kinda tough!
          Still, I enjoy the process and the thrill of discovering how systems
          work, how to secure them, and, of course, how to break into them
          ethically.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-black">
          I'm currently a 3rd-grade student at SMKN 2 Mataram, majoring in
          Software Engineering. I’ve been working on various projects, from web
          development to networking, and I’m now focusing on mastering Cyber
          Security.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-black">
          My journey in tech is far from over, and I’m always open to learning
          new things, collaborating, and improving my skills. If you share the
          same interests, let’s connect and explore this ever-evolving world
          together!
